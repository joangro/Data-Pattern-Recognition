function [ accuracy confusionMatrix ] = testMethod( data , labels, labelsUsed , errorMeasure, indexesCrossVal )
% TESTMETHOD This function estimates the accuracy and confusion over the dataset samples in data by using Cross Validation 
% the input template matching method and the error measure method.
% INPUTS:
% data: NxDxD , matrix with the images or shape data of the dataset
% labels: 1xN vector with the emotion labels for each sample in the matrix data.
% labelsUsed: labels used to train and classify.
% templateMethod: string with the method used to generate the template.
% errorMeasuse: string with the error measure method used to compare the template with the samples.
% indexesCrossVal: indexes used to perform the performance evaluation with cross validation

indexes = indexesCrossVal;
K = max(indexes);

confusionMatrix = zeros(numel(labelsUsed));
for k = 1:K
    display(['Testing data subset: ' num2str(k) '/' num2str(K)]);
    %get train and test dataset with the indexes obtained with the KFold
    %cross validation
    train = data(indexes~=k,:,:);
    labelsTrain = labels(indexes~=k);
    test = data(indexes==k,:,:);
    labelsTest = labels(indexes==k);
